My name is Philip Lewallen.  I am starting my second year in the OSU Computer Science major.  I hope to be entirely done by the end of Summer this year.  I really enjoy computer science and chose it after a very long period of considering possible career choices.  I'm looking forward to this class as I am very interested in both cloud computing and services and also large data access through web pages.

#Programming Background
I have only started programming with ernest after I decided to re-enter the field of comptuer science, last year in the fall.  I made this choice when my first program in CS162 was completed without errors or warnings.  It was just a very satisfying feeling.
