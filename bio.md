My name is Philip Lewallen.  I am starting my second year in the OSU Computer Science major.  I hope to be entirely done by the end of Summer this year.  I really enjoy computer science and chose it after a very long period of considering possible career choices.  I'm looking forward to this class as I am very interested in both cloud computing and services and also large data access through web pages.

A couple of my favorite activities are riding motorcycles, skiing, and bicycling.  I'm also a big fan of food.  Yeup.  And of course, video games aren't too bad either.

#Programming Background
I have only started programming with ernest after I decided to re-enter the field of comptuer science, last year in the fall.  I made this choice when my first program in CS162 was completed without errors or warnings.  It was just a very satisfying feeling.  

My favorite program so far was the Traveling Salesman Problem.  It was the first "real" problem solved which I was a part of.  It was also very fun to work on a problem which had multiple versions each improving on the previous.  

 This is the extra content I am adding for step 12.  It is some very good content.  I would add more, but to be honest, this is about the 10th time I have run through these steps due to me making a very avoid and stupid error.
