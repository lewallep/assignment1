My name is Philip Lewallen.  I am starting my second year in the OSU Computer Science major.  I hope to be entirely done by the end of Summer this year.  I really enjoy computer science and chose it after a very long period of considering possible career choices.  I'm looking forward to this class as I am very interested in both cloud computing and services and also large data access through web pages.

A couple of my favorite activities are riding motorcycles, skiing, and bicycling.  I'm also a big fan of food.  Yeup.  And of course, video games aren't too bad either.
